            <p>Ethics are principles that control a person.  Ethics aren't necessarily illegal, but they are wrong.
                In a job, you could get fired for unethical practice.  In a normal day-to-day basis, you could get jailtime
                or just be judged for being a bad person.  Ethics works with your morals.  You should always think about
                if what you're doing is unethical or not.  Ethics comes with a bunch of different codes.
                You have ethical codes for bosses, students, employees, teachers, and there are even codes for religion.
