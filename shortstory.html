            <p>There’s a girl named Rachel.  She works for PSL Construction.  Alex started from the bottom.  He grew up 
                in a terrible area with his single father. His mother died from cancer when he was 12.  His father worked 
                two full time jobs to try and give Alex a good life.  They didn’t have a whole bunch of money while he was
                growing up, but his father always made sure he had what he wanted.  Alex’s father worked to put Alex 
                through college.  After college, Alex thrived.  He started his own business and ended up making millions.
                While in college, he met Rachel.  He had a major crush on her, but it eventually died out.  In college,
                Rachel wanted to work in the construction field, while Alex wanted to learn more about business.  
                When he learned Rachel had succeeded in working in the construction field, he decided to contact her 
                about a project.  He wanted to get an office building built.  He wanted to rent out offices, but he 
                also wanted an official office himself.  She was thrilled and wanted to help him, so he became a 
                client of PSL Construction. Rachel started the project, but immediately ran into issues. Rachel had to get permits
                to start the project. She went the permits office and they aren't giving her the permits she needed, so she fixes the issues and tries again.  It doesn’t work again.  
                She keeps trying and trying to get the permits, but it is just not working out and she isn’t understanding
                why.  Alex is getting tired of having to wait for his building to be built, so he takes matters into his 
                own hands.  His idea to bribe the permits office.  He goes back and forth with himself to determine if he should actualyl
                bribe them.  He thinks on it for a couple days, but ultimately decides to do it. Alex goes to the permits office and bribes the permit clerk.  He pays them $100,000 to get it
                done.   The next day, Rachel gets a call that she has all the permits and can officially build Alex’s 
                office building.  Rachel is skeptical, but thanks the permits office and starts the building process.  
                Something doesn’t sit right with Rachel.  She starts to think about it all the time.  She wonders how they would 
                all of the sudden have every single permit.  She wonders what would've happened to get all of her permits. 
                She finally starts investigating.  She goes to Alex and asks if 
                he did anything and he just gives vague answers, she gets fed up with the answers.  She goes to the permits office.  
                They are also giving vague answers, but there’s one person who is being dead silent, her name is Dana.  Rachel assumes that Dana
                is being silent because there is something she wants to say, so Rachel offers 
                to take Dana out to lunch.  She reluctantly agree and they go to lunch.  While there, Rachel asks what happened.
                Dana is hesitant at first, but then she just lets everything out.  She said Alex came up there and bribed them.  She said she accepted the
                money, because she didn’t think it would be that bad.  She said she just feels so guilty for taking the
                money and she wants to give it back. Rachel thanks Dana for meeting with her, pays for the food, and 
                leaves.  Rachel plans to go and confront Alex, but she thinks for a minute.  She realizes she can get something more.
                The next day, she goes to confront Alex. She tells Alex that she 
                knows everything about the bribe.  She then says that if Alex doesn’t give her $10,000 payments every 
                month then she would tell everyone about the bribe.  Alex agrees and it works for a while, but 
                eventually everything comes crashing down.  Dana felt so guilty that she told somebody about what 
                happened.  Dana was fired along with the other permit clerks.  Alex and his building were investigated
                and they found so many violations that they had to tear the building right back down.  Since Alex 
                was already going down, he explained that Rachel expected money from him.  They went to Rachel and 
                the PSL Construction owners and explained what was happening.  Rachel was fired.  Alex felt terrible, so he hired Rachel as 
                a freelance worker to help him build his projects.  She agrees and they end up doing well for themselves.
