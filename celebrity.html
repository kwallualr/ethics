                <dt>Logan Paul</dt>
                <dd>Logan Paul is a Youtuber.  I added him to the list because he advertised
                    a cryptocurrency scam called Cryptozoo.  Many people invested in it and lost 
                    a lot of money.  
                </dd>
                <dt>Taylor Swift</dt>
                <dd>Taylor Swift is a famous singer.  She was added to the list because she 
                    preaches about keeping the world safe and being environmentally friendly, 
                    but she consistently flies her plane everywhere.  She has even taken a 15
                    minute flight.

                <dt>Mark Zuckerberg</dt>
                <dd>Mark Zuckerberg is one of the founders of Facebook. He was added to the list
                    because he did an experiment with Cambridge Analytica.  For this experiment, he 
                    allowed them to take data from a bunch of people without them knowing or consenting.
                </dd>
                <dt>Tiger Woods</dt>
                <dd>Tiger Woods is an American golfer.  He was added to this list because he has cheated
                    on wife multiple times.  It may not be that unethical, but it was still unethical. 
                </dd>
                <dt>Oprah Winfrey</dt>
                <dd>Oprah Winfrey is a talk-show host who was added to this list because she exploits people.
                    She seems to use people to talk about their problems and issues out loud for views.
                    She is friends with known predators, while also advocating for victims of sexual assualt. 
                </dd>
                <dt>Dan Schneider</dt>
                <dd>Dan Schneider was a producer.  He was added to this list because of the way he treated his 
                    cast.  He treated everyone on his set like garbage.  He would always make a woman give him 
                    massages, but wouldn't listen to any of their ideas.  He would ask children to stay past the
                    time they were allowed as child actors. 
                </dd>
                <dt>The Paparazzi</dt>
                <dd>They aren't celebrities, but they follow them around a lot.  They 
                    constantly invade the privacy of individuals for news no one really 
                    cares about.  They go so far for little bits and pieces of information.
                    They will trespass and block off exits to buildings or block off roads.
