                <dt><strong><u>Kylie Jenner</u></strong></dt>
                <dd>Kylie Jenner is a cosmetic business owner.  She was added to this list because 
                    of her cosmetic business.  Kylie has taken a tour of her facility for the Keeping up with the Kardashians 
                    show and while in the facility, she didn't wear a mask, hairnet, or gloves.  She even picked up a makeup
                    tool to swatch the makeup on her bare hands and put the tool back into the makeup container. I would consider this 
                    unethical because she knowingly entered her facility and put a bunch of products at risk on television.
                </dd>
                <dt><strong><u>Led Zeppelin</u></strong></dt>
                <dd>Led Zeppelin is a band.  They are on this list because they stole music from other artists.
                    They used this music as their own.  I consider this unethical because they stole and profited 
                    off of someone else's work.
                </dd>
                <dt><strong><u>Logan Paul</u></strong></dt>
                <dd>Logan Paul is a Youtuber.  I added him to the list because he advertised
                    a cryptocurrency scam called Cryptozoo.  Many people invested in it and lost 
                    a lot of money.  I would consider this unethical because he would've known it 
                    wasn't as good as he said, but he conviced people to spend their money on it anyways.
                </dd>
                <dt><strong><u>Taylor Swift</u></strong></dt>
                <dd>Taylor Swift is a famous singer.  She was added to the list because she 
                    preaches about keeping the world safe and being environmentally friendly, 
                    but she consistently flies her plane everywhere.  She has even taken a 15
                    minute flight.  I consider this unethical because she pollutes the world even more
                    and being hypocritical about it.
                </dd>
                <dt><strong><u>Bill Belichick</u></strong></dt>
                <dd>Bill Belichick was the coach for the New England Patriots.  He was added to
                    the list because he cheated.  He got people on his team to record the other teams' 
                    signals. I consider this unethical because it is cheating.  It is never ethical, but 
                    he profitted off of stealing other people's practices.
                </dd>
                <dt><strong><u>Mark Zuckerberg</u></strong></dt>
                <dd>Mark Zuckerberg is one of the founders of Facebook. He was added to the list
                    because he did an experiment with Cambridge Analytica.  For this experiment, he 
                    allowed them to take data from a bunch of people without them knowing or consenting.
                    I consider this unethical because he didn't tell anyone about the experiment and he 
                    just left Cambridge take any bit of data they wanted.
                </dd>
                <dt><strong><u>Tiger Woods</u></strong></dt>
                <dd>Tiger Woods is an American golfer.  He was added to this list because he has cheated
                    on wife multiple times.  It may not be that unethical, but it was still unethical. I consider this unethical
                    because again, it is cheating.  He knowingly cheated knowing it would hurt his wife and did it
                    more after knowing it hurt his wife.
                </dd>
                <dt><strong><u>Oprah Winfrey</u></strong></dt>
                <dd>Oprah Winfrey is a talk-show host who was added to this list because she exploits people.
                    She seems to use people to talk about their problems and issues out loud for views.
                    She is friends with known predators, while also advocating for victims of sexual assualt. 
                    I consider this unethical because it is hypocritical and she is friends with known predators.  
                    She also uses people to profit off of them without caring how they feel.
                </dd>
                <dt><strong><u>Dan Schneider</u></strong></dt>
                <dd>Dan Schneider was a producer.  He was added to this list because of the way he treated his 
                    cast.  He treated everyone on his set like garbage.  He would always make a woman give him 
                    massages, but wouldn't listen to any of their ideas.  He would ask children to stay past the
                    time they were allowed as child actors. I consider this unethical because he would break child 
                    labor laws, he was abusive towards his staff and would constantly threaten to fire them.
                </dd>
                <dt><strong><u>The Paparazzi</u></strong></dt>
                <dd>They aren't celebrities, but they follow them around a lot.  They 
                    constantly invade the privacy of individuals for news no one really 
                    cares about.  They go so far for little bits and pieces of information.
                    They will trespass and block off exits to buildings or block off roads.
