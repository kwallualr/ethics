            <p>It is a whole lot, but it is what I could remember.  This all happened a couple months ago while I was working
                at Little Caesars.  It was a great job, but a terrible environment and even worse management.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>At Little Caesar’s, they would watch the cameras all the time.  Not even to just see if everyone was 
                    working or to see if something bad was happening.  The district manager would just watch for fun. </li>
                <li>The manager was hypocritical.  The manager would tell you not to do something and then do it herself 
                    just to show she was in charge.  She would say you can’t take food home without asking and then she 
                    would take food home to her family every night without asking her boss.  </li>
                <li>She would intentionally start arguments with everyone like she was in high school.  She would accuse 
                    people of doing things they weren’t doing.</li>
                <li>They were trying to get people to quit.  They would never fire people, so they would just get them to 
                    quit and that’s part of the reason she would start the arguments. </li>
            </ul>
